#Ionic2/Electron Starter Project

While it seemed straightforward to do this at first, there were a few quirks that made me create this repo in case I have to do it again. It saves a few hours.

So using Ionic2 and Electron you can build applications using Ionic2/Angular2 in one code base that compiles into applications for:

- Windows
- OSX
- Linux
- Android
- IOS
- Web

It's a work in progress. So feel free to fork and do pull requests.

Currently `gulp build` will build the web, android and ios apps and `gulp electron:all` will build the Windows, OSX, and Linux applications.

##TODO

- task to build all applications with one command
- task to do a full release process, with auto versioning, etc.
- add auto-updating with https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder


## be careful
if you are developping in windows it's necessary to adapt scripts command in package.json
